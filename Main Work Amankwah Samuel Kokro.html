    <p>I am Amankwah Samuel Kokro. I am 19 years of age. I come from Atebubu in the Bono East region but lives at Taifa in Dome-Kwabenya Constituency, Greater Accra Region. I offered General Science in Presbyterian Boys’ Secondary School (PRESEC–LEGON) in the Greater Accra region and currently offering Biomedical Engineering in Kwame Nkrumah University Of Science And Technology (KNUST).</p>
    <p>I am a biomedical engineering student in BME 1. I like this course because it connects medicine and engineering; where Biomedical engineers make tools, equipments, machines used in the health sector and artificial internal organs. It’s a field where innovation meets compassion, and I find that incredibly inspiring. </p>
    <p>The idea of designing solutions that can improve or even save lives: whether it’s through advanced medical devices, cutting-edge prosthetics, or groundbreaking diagnostic tools—feels meaningful and purposeful to me. Biomedical Engineering Courses are nice and interesting to study.</p>
